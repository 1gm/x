Miscellaneous experiments I'm working on - they probably don't work!

* deathcounter
  * WINDOWS only - writes to text files when certain hotkeys are pressed
* download-server
  * HTTP server to download files from localhost to a directory, used with TamperMonkey (not secure at all)
* hearthstone-deckstring
  * Hearthstone deckstring decoding/encoding example
* html-speaker
  * An HTML audio player which plays audio data received over websocket connection
* kraken-ticker
  * Fetches rates from the Kraken API on an interval and writes them to a file
* text-to-speech
  * AWS polly integration which parses input from a directory, synthesizes them, and saves them as MP3s to an output 
    directory.
  * Plays the synthesized text files
* twitch-websockets
  * An integration with the Twitch websocket API to listen for channel point redemptions
